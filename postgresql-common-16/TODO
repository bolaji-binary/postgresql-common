postgresql TODO
===============

Bugs:
- parse and use avac_debug
- pg_upgradecluster: try to start the new cluster on temp port with
  new conffiles before changing the ports
- pg_upgradecluster: handle 7.4->8.0 option transitions:
  * syslog=0/1/2 -> log_destination=stderr/'stderr,syslog'/syslog
  * log_statement=false/true -> none/all
  * log_pid=false/true -> (nothing)/log_line_prefix='%p'
  * log_timestamp=false/true -> (nothing)/log_line_prefix='%t'
  * log_hostname=false/true -> (nothing)/log_line_prefix='%r'
  * log_source_port=false/true -> (nothing)/log_line_prefix='%r'
- Link README.Debian to the server packages.
- pg_wrapper(1) synopsis: make clear that this is valid for all client
  programs

Transition bugs:
- Continue to use the old log file.
- Print a very short help after the transition is complete and make it
  more verbose.

Important features:
- add infrastructure to support running scripts/SQL commands on all
  databases on upgrading (like necessary for the two recent CANs)
- SSL support out of the box (create certificate)

Wishlist:
