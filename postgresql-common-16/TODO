postgresql TODO
===============

Bugs:
- parse and use avac_debug
- pg_upgradecluster: try to start the new cluster on temp port with
  new conffiles before changing the ports
- pg_upgradecluster: handle 7.4->8.0 option transitions:
- pg_upgradecluster: Fix log rotation of old log file.

Transition bugs:
- Continue to use the old log file.
- Print a very short help after the transition is complete and make it
  more verbose.

Important features:
- add infrastructure to support running scripts/SQL commands on all
  databases on upgrading (like necessary for the two recent CANs)
- SSL support out of the box (create certificate)
