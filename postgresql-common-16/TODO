postgresql TODO
===============

Bugs:
- parse and use avac_debug
- pg_upgradecluster: handle 7.4->8.0 syslog option transition
- pg_upgradecluster: handle 7.4->8.0 log_pid option transition
- pg_upgradecluster: try to start the new cluster on temp port with
  new conffiles before changing the ports

Important features:
- add infrastructure to support running scripts/SQL commands on all
  databases on upgrading (like necessary for the two recent CANs)
- SSL support out of the box (create certificate)

Wishlist:
