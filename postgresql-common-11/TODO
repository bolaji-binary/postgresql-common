postgresql TODO
===============

- pg_upgradecluster: support binary dumps
- pg_upgradecluster: support writing into dump file
- (maybe) use lsb-init functions if they are available
- add infrastructure to support running scripts/SQL commands on all
  databases on upgrading (like necessary for the two recent CANs)
- POD: add extra section OPTIONS
