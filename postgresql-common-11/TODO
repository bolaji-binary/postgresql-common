postgresql TODO
===============

- pg_wrapper: Fix socket dir for default cluster if there is more than
  one cluster and no user-cluster map entry.
- pg_upgradecluster: support binary dumps
- pg_upgradecluster: support writing into dump file
- pg_createcluster: add --socket-dir parameter
- (maybe) use lsb-init functions if they are available
- add infrastructure to support running scripts/SQL commands on all
  databases on upgrading (like necessary for the two recent CANs)
- pg_createcluster: default to user postgres with no -u
