postgresql TODO
===============

Bugs:
- Use pg_dump/pg_restore with custom format in pg_upgradecluster
- Instead of calling pg_maintenance, call ANALYZE after an upgraded database.

Transition bugs:
- check for obsolete 8.1 configuration items
- automatically set "autovacuum = yes/no" value

Missing selftest:
- pg_wrapper env vars (PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER)
- start.conf handling
- start.conf upgrades

Important features:

Wishlist:
- add programs for web applications, which configure pg_hba.conf:

  pg_add_hba [options] yourwebappdb yourwebappuser
  pg_test_hba [options] yourwebappdb yourwebappuser
  pg_remove_hba [options] yourwebappdb yourwebappuser

  Options:

  --cluster: self-explanatory, defaults to default cluster
  --ip: IP and netmask for host socket; if not given, defaults to Unix
    socket (local)
  --method: defaults to "md5" for TCP connections, and "ident sameuser" for
    Unix socket connections
  --force-ssl: If given, create a "hostssl" entry, otherwise a "host"
    entry

  For pg_remove_hba, only --cluster is allowed; it will remove all hba
  entries that refer to the given db/user pair. pg_test_hba checks whether the
  given connection is allowed; if so, it exits with 0, otherwise it prints the
  required pg_hba.conf line to stdout and exits with 1. If pg_hba.conf has a
  scrambled format that cannot be parsed by pg_*_hba, the scripts exit with 2.

  Add libnet-cidr-perl dependency!
