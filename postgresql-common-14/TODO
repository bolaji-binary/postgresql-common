postgresql TODO
===============

Bugs:

Important features:
- add infrastructure to support running scripts/SQL commands on all
  databases on upgrading (like necessary for the two recent CANs)
- SSL support out of the box (create certificate)

Wishlist:
- pg_upgradecluster: support writing into dump file
