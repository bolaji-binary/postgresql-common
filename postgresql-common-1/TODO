postgresql TODO
===============

Man pages are installed in /usr/share/postgresql/<X.Y>/man.  Provide a
program to be run by the postinst script to run update-alternatives
on every manpage to link it to /usr/share/man/man/<X.Y>/<page>

Provide do.maintenance which vacuums all running clusters.

postgresql-contrib-x.x need to check a file supplied by
postgresql-common to see whether and with what parameters to run
autovacuum.

Write a utility to change the port on which a particular postmaster
is running or to create a database and start a postmaster on some
new port:
   a.    Prompt for current port (if any);
   b.    If current port is not blank:
          shutdown the postmaster on that port
          look up PostgreSQL version from
          /etc/postgresql/cluster.ports
          prompt for new port
          move /etc/postgresql/<oldport> to .../<newport>
          edit /etc/postgresql/<newport>/postgresql.conf 
      else
          prompt for: cluster.ports parameters
          write line in cluster.ports
          create /etc/postgresql/<newport>
          initdb
          move $PGDATA/config files to /etc/postgresql/<newport> and
   	 create symlinks in their place
          
   c.    Start postmaster on the new port

create update transition packages from legacy 7.4 packages
