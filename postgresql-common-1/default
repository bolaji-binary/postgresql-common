# lower, postgresql.startup attempts to increase it by writing this parameter 
# into /proc/sys/kernel/file-max.  This is only effective if the kernel has
# been compiled to support run-time configuration.

# applied to the system.

# Warning: if you use syslog for logging (syslog=2 in postgresql.conf) for
# any cluster, you may not be able to distinguish the output for different
# postmasters, unless you take special steps to have syslog put its logging
# into separate files.
#
# You can override this setting for individual clusters
#
# If you change this, remember to change /etc/logrotate.d/postgresql too.
