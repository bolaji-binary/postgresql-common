# This file maps PostgreSQL database clusters against their database
# versions, the ports on which their postmasters are to listen, the Unix
# logins of their administrators and the directories where their data are
# to be found.
#
# Cluster:  the name of the cluster; this must be unique in this file.
# Status:   "active" if a postmaster should be started at boot time;
#           "inactive" if it can only be started by the administrator;
#           "upgrading" only when the database is being upgraded from
#           one major version to another - an "upgrading" database is
#           inaccessible except to the administrator;
#           "failed-upgrade" if an upgrade failed.
# Owner:    The Unix login of the cluster owner and administrator.
# Version:  The database version of the cluster.
# Port:     The port on which this cluster's postmaster should listen;
#           ports 5430 and 5431 are reserved for cluster upgrades.
# Pgdata:   The pathname of the data directory for this cluster.
#
# This file will be altered by initdb, which will add lines when a
# new cluster is created.  pg_version_upgrade will change the active flag
# to "upgrading" while an upgrade is taking place
