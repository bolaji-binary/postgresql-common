.SH NAME
user_clusters \- File linking users to PostgreSQL clusters
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This file maps users against the database clusters to which they will
connect by default.  Any user may use 
.B pg-wrapper -c
to set a new
default to be stored in 
.I $HOME/.postgresqlrc
and the existence of that file
will supersede anything stored here.
.P
When scanning this file, the first matching line will be used.  It is a
good idea to provide a default explicitly, with a final line where both
user and group are set to 
.BR * .
This can be done by the command
.BI "pg_wrapper -a -c " cluster " -d 
.IR database .
If there is no default, the implicit default
is to connect to the cluster whose postmaster is listening on port 5432
and to the database matching the user's login name.
.SH FORMAT
.P
Comments are introduced by the character
.BR # .
Comments may follow data on a line; the first comment character terminates
the data.
Leading whitespace and blank lines are ignored.
.P
Each uncommented, non-blank line must describe a user, group or the
default (where both user and group are set to 
.BR * .
.P
Fields must be given in the following order, separated by white space:
.TP
.B USER
The login id of the Unix user to whom this line applies. The wildcard character
.B *
means any user.
.TP
.B GROUP
The group name of the Unix group to which this line applies. The wildcard character
.B *
means any group.
.TP
.B VERSION
The major PostgreSQL version of the cluster to connect to.
.TP
.B CLUSTER
The name of a cluster to connect to.
.TP
.B DATABASE
Within the cluster, the database to which the user will connect by default
if he does not specify a database on the command line.  If this is
.BR * ,
the default database will be the one named by the user's login id.
.SH NOTES
.P
Since the first matching line is used, the default line must come last.
.P
This file may be altered by
.B pg_default
when run by root or postgres.
