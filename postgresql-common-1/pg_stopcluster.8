.TH pg_stopcluster 8 "January 01, 2005" "Martin Pitt"

.SH NAME
pg_stopcluster \- manually stop a PostgreSQL cluster

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pg_stopluster
.I version clustername

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pg_stopcluster 
stops the PostgreSQL server cluster (i. e. a
collection of databases served by a postmaster instance) of the given
version and name.

This script essentially wraps the
.B pg_ctl stop
command, with increasing force (first in "fast" mode, then
"immediate", and if that still does not stop the postmaster, it uses
"kill \-9" to kill the postmaster process).

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR pg_startcluster (8),
.BR pg_reloadcluster (8),
.BR pg_lsclusters (1),
.BR pg_wrapper (1)
