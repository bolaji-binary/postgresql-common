postgresql TODO
===============

Bugs:
- pg_createcluster: guess correct encoding for 7.4 dbs

Important features:
- add infrastructure to support running scripts/SQL commands on all
  databases on upgrading (like necessary for the two recent CANs)
- SSL support out of the box (create certificate)

Wishlist:
- pg_upgradecluster: support writing into dump file
- (maybe) use lsb-init functions if they are available
- test suite: temporarily move away existing clusters
- ship test suite in package
