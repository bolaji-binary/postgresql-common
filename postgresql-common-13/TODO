postgresql TODO
===============

Bugs:
- pg_createcluster: guess correct encoding for 7.4 dbs
- pg_ctlcluster: Check if autovacuum daemon is really running, cat log
  if not.
- pg_upgradecluster: use the same socket directory 
- pg_upgradecluster: use the same encoding

Important features:
- add infrastructure to support running scripts/SQL commands on all
  databases on upgrading (like necessary for the two recent CANs)
- SSL support out of the box (create certificate)
- Test suite: Check cluster creation in unicode locale.
- Test suite: Check cluster upgrade socket and encoding preservation.

Wishlist:
- pg_upgradecluster: support writing into dump file
- ship test suite in package
