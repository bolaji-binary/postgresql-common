postgresql TODO
===============

Bugs:
- pg_ctlcluster: Check if autovacuum daemon is really running, cat log
  if not.
- Check whether mutually exclusive log_*_stats are enabled both in a
  7.4 cluster to avoid the "FATAL:  invalid cache id: 30" error

Important features:
- add infrastructure to support running scripts/SQL commands on all
  databases on upgrading (like necessary for the two recent CANs)
- SSL support out of the box (create certificate)

Wishlist:
- pg_upgradecluster: support writing into dump file
- ship test suite in package
