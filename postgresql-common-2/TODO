postgresql TODO
===============

Man pages are installed in /usr/share/postgresql/<X.Y>/man.  Provide a
program to be run by the postinst script to run update-alternatives
on every manpage to link it to /usr/share/man/man/<X.Y>/<page>

Provide do.maintenance which vacuums all running clusters.

postgresql-contrib-x.x need to check a file supplied by
postgresql-common to see whether and with what parameters to run
autovacuum.

recheck ports of already existing clusters on installation (might collide)
