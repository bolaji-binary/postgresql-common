postgresql-common (1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New package to provide a common infrastructure for different PostgreSQL
    versions. This finally fixes all bugs concerning failed automatic
    upgrades. Closes: #277700, #282803, #224047, #229240, #232553, #279184,
    #241337, #247261, #157282
  * pg_wrapper now has a central role for mapping clients to clusters, so it
    is not "overkill" any more. Closes: #201702
