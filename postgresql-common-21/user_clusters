# This file maps users against the database clusters to which they
# will connect by default.  Any user may use "pg-wrapper -c" to set a
# new default to be stored in ~/.postgresqlrc and the existence of
# that file will supersede anything stored here.  If a database is
# specified, that will be the one connected to by client tools if none
# is specified on the command line.  If the database specified here is
# "*", this is interpreted as the database whose name is the same as
# the user's login.  (Setting the database to "*" will provide the
# current default upstream behaviour for command line tools.)
#
# When pg_wrapper scans this file, the first matching line is used.  It is a
# good idea to provide a default explicitly, with a final line where both
# user and group are set to "*".  If there is no default, the implicit default
# is to connect to the cluster whose postmaster is listening on port 5432
# and to the database matching the user's login name.
#
# This file may be altered by pg_wrapper -u when run by root.
#
# In the context of this file, user and group refer to the Unix login or
# group, not to PostgreSQL users and groups.
