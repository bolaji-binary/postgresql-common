postgresql TODO
===============

Bugs:

Transition bugs:
- Print a very short help after the transition is complete and make it
  more verbose.
- Check that we are upgrading from << 7.5.
- Get rid of postgres' .profile (#312514)

Important features:
- add infrastructure to support running scripts/SQL commands on all
  databases on upgrading (like necessary for the two recent CANs)
- SSL support out of the box (create certificate)

Wishlist:
