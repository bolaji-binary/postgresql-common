postgresql TODO
===============

Provide do.maintenance which vacuums all running clusters.

recheck ports of already existing clusters on installation (might collide)

document autovacuum stuff in architecture.html and POD

if there is only one cluster, use this, don't insist on port 5432

start postmaster under the locale used by initdb
