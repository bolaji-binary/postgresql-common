postgresql TODO
===============

Provide do.maintenance which vacuums all running clusters.

postgresql-contrib-x.x need to check a file supplied by
postgresql-common to see whether and with what parameters to run
autovacuum.

recheck ports of already existing clusters on installation (might collide)
